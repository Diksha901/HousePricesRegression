#  House Prices Prediction (Regression)

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning regression models, including **Decision Tree Regressor**, **Random Forest Regressor**, **XGBoost Regressor**, and a **Stacked Ensemble** model. The dataset used is based on housing data with various features describing the properties.

##  Models Used

1. **Decision Tree Regressor**
   - Basic model to understand decision-based splits.
   - Prone to overfitting but useful for baseline.

2. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Ensemble of Decision Trees using bagging.
   - Reduces variance and improves generalization.

3. **XGBoost Regressor**
   - Gradient boosting algorithm for high performance.
   - Handles missing data and feature importance well.

4. **Stacked Regressor (Ensemble)**
   - Combines predictions from the above models .
   - Yielded improved performance.
